Overview
Submarine Mission is a 3D submarine simulation built using C# and OpenGL (OpenTK). The project features real-time movement, dynamic lighting, animated sea creatures, and realistic underwater effects. The player can navigate the submarine, control its speed, depth, and lights, and experience an immersive underwater environment.

🎮 Features
✅ 3D Submarine Movement – Navigate forward, backward, rotate, and change depth.
✅ Dynamic Lighting & Shadows – Realistic submarine spotlight with soft shadows.
✅ Textured Environment – Ocean floor, submarine, and fish with high-quality textures.
✅ Animated Sea Creatures – Fish swim dynamically, reacting to the environment.
✅ Realistic Bubbles – Rising air bubbles when the submarine moves.
✅ Fog & Water Effects – Depth-based fog for an authentic underwater feel.
✅ User Interaction – Toggle lights, check submarine speed, and explore freely.

🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 C# – Programming language
🔹 OpenGL (OpenTK) – Graphics rendering
🔹 Texture Mapping – Applied to submarine, ocean floor, and fish
🔹 Stencil Buffer Shadows – Realistic shadow projection
